'''

Write a program that reads a list of integers from input and 
modifies the list by shifting each element to the right one 
position and by shifting the last element to the first position. 
The input begins with an integer indicating the number of values that 
follow. Output the modified list and end with a newline.

Ex: If the input is:

6 
2
4
6
8
10
12
the output is:

12 2 4 6 8 10 
For coding simplicity, follow every output value by a space, 
including the last one.
